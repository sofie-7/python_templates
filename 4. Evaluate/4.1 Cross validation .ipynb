    "Cross validation is a good technique to measure your model before showing it the test data set. The full training dataset is used, but then split further into k sets to train and test the model k times (i.e. split the training data 8 ways, where by an 1/8 is withheld and the model is trained on the remaining data then that 1/8 is used to test the model. Then the next 1/8 is withheld, to test the model etc. until you have 8 sets of results).  \n",
